# .github-workflows-simple-workflow.yml
This configuration sets up a simple workflow that runs whenever new changes are pushed to the main branch of your repository. It defines a single job called "build" that runs on an Ubuntu virtual machine, and it contains two steps: one to check out the code from the repository, and one to print a message to the console.
